"Even though the prices of ham might fluctuate, our quality reassures that it will never change. Large Ham, was originally created by Band Leader Father Porcine in an attempt to bring attention to the issues at hand. Like not having enough cold cuts for a sandwich. Or the lack of bacon in a breakfast meal. By bringing together the best musicians at Northeastern University, they wish to tell the world of everything that is on their mind. Or something."

"Father Porcine is an infamous bagpipe player, from Ohio, he grew up on a Pig farm, and learned music by imitating the sound he would hear around him. He went to Juliard and made money selling hot dogs. one day his life changed when he learned of the superiority of ham over all other meat, and decided to dedicate his life work to the worship of ham."

<h3>Bari Sax, Single</h3>
<p>
"Lucius, originally a electrician was found by Father Porcine on the side of the street after a long maitenance run. Safe to say, things happened, and now Lucius play the Bari-Sax for LARGE HAM. On top of that, Lucius loves long walks on the beach and pastries. During their free time, they do nothing at all."

<h3>Bobby Tofu - Supporting Keyboardist, Probable Cultist?</h3>
<p>
	"Bobby Tofu gave up meat after a spiritual encounter with a lettuce leaf in mayo.
He moved to boston from seoul, studied bean-based sound, and somehow ended up in Large Ham.
He plays keys, performs pre-show rituals, and refuses to look ham in the eye."

<h3>Hanako – Lead Guitar Extraordinaire / Shred Queen of Swine</h3>
<p>
	Hanako didn’t choose ham — ham chose her. Everything changed the day she saw Father Porcine wailing on the bagpipes behind Juilliard while roasting hot dogs on a portable grill. The sheer intensity of his greasy conviction, combined with the unmistakable scent of destiny (and sizzling pork), struck something deep within her. Moved beyond reason, she abandoned her quiet life — and possibly her sanity — to join Large Ham. Now she shreds in the name of smoked protein, claiming the ham once spoke to her in a dream. “I thought I understood life,” she says, “until I met ham... and distortion.”

<h3>Listen to our new single</h3>
<p>
	On the surface, PORQI may sound like a chaotic parade of mismatched instruments—bagpipes, clavinet, guitar, and a whistle that cuts through the air. Yet within that apparent disorder, the piece carves out its own distinct sense of structure.
The bagpipes summon echoes of forgotten traditions and collective memory, while the clavinet expresses an isolated identity, detached from its usual context. The guitar moves fluidly, following the tides of improvisational emotion, and the whistle acts as a subconscious cry that threads through all elements.
The name porqi goes beyond simple wordplay; it points to the fundamental questions embedded within the piece: Why? What is pork? And how did it become ham?
This track offers no fixed interpretation. Instead, it demands that the listener create their own.

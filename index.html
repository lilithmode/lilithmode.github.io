<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>
"Even though the prices of ham might fluctuate, our quality reassures that it will never change. Large Ham, was originally created by Band Leader Father Porcine in an attempt to bring attention to the issues at hand. Like not having enough cold cuts for a sandwich. Or the lack of bacon in a breakfast meal. By bringing together the best musicians at Northeastern University, they wish to tell the world of everything that is on their mind. Or something."

Father Porcine is an infamous bagpipe player, from Ohio, he grew up on a Pig farm, and learned music by imitating the sound he would hear around him. He went to Juliard and made money selling hot dogs. one day his life changed when he learned of the superiority of ham over all other meat, and decided to dedicate his life work to the worship of ham.
